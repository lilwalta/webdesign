      The pre-registration process is the very first contact your attendees have with your organization's event. If registration
      is a simple and trouble-free experience for them, then it is a direct reflection on your organization's professionalism
      and your attendees are more excited about your event! By allowing IE Events to manage your conference online registration,
      your attendees are provided with user-friendly and efficient method of registering for your event and you and your staff
      are free to focus on other business. We offer an accurate and cost-efficient method of registering your attendees for
      your conference or event. Even if you are already using a registration service, we will make every effort to give you the best deal.

      Save time and avoid errors by having all your attendees enter their own information. When your attendees register for
      their own event, they will be entering all their own information, therefore assuring accuracy of the data collected
      and time saved on your organizations part by not having to enter the data yourselves. All registration data can be
      exported from your admin page so that you can edit it in Microsoft Access or Excel, send form letters, run name badges,
      reports, etc. Receive Up-to-date Financial Information. As your conference or event attendees register, you will have
      a constant and up-to-date report of conference revenue.

      If you register groups for your event such as schools, churches, scout troops, etc., we have you covered. We can give
      each group their own login account where the group leader can add, edit, and maintain their own group registration.
      From your admin page, you will see each group name and their summary information. When you click on the group name,
      you will see the detailed information for the group, including their individual participants, workshops or events they
      signed up for if applicable.
