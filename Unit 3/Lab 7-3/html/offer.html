        <h2>What We Offer</h2>

        <p>
            We can provide your conference or event a professional registration process that is easy to use.
            If you use our services for your next event, we can offer you:

            <li>Name badges for all your attendees.</li>
            <li>Administrative login with a number of valuable services.</li>
            <li>The ability for you to log in and manage your conference registration.</li>
            <li>The ability to register groups or individuals.</li>
            <li>The ability to change your event registration fee at any time.</li>
            <li>The ability to start and stop online registration for your event from your administrative login.</li>
            <li>The ability to export all your registration data, so it can be opened and worked with in Microsoft Excel, Access, or Word.</li>
            <li>Printable list of conference or event attendees.</li>
            <li>Ability to register your conference or event attendees in competitive events or workshops, classes, etc.</li>
            <li>The option for your attendees to order customized shirts for your event or conference.</li>
            <li>Customized Login Page: We will design a login page that you can directly link to from your organization's website. Your login page can include specific information on your event and your organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Administrative Features: You as the event coordinator will have the ability to control your event's registration.
            You can start the pre-registration process when you are ready and end the process when you are ready to export your data.
            You can even set the price for your registration. If you are selling conference items with registration such as shirts,
            you can set those prices as well from your login page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Email Broadcasting: You have the ability to send announcements and updates to your conference attendees directly from
            your event administration page. Conference/Event Shirts: Shirts are a popular item for event attendees. If you choose
            to offer shirts, attendees can order them while registering for your event and have the price added to their total registration
            cost. You can use your own shirt design company to create your conference shirts, or we can have them made for you if you
            provide us with your shirt graphic. If we have your conference or event shirts made, we will need to be provided with a
            physical address deliverable by UPS.
        </p>

        <p>
            Name Badges: If you would like us to provide name badges for your attendees, we will be more than happy to do so.
            Name tags can be run for all pre-registered attendees for your event, and we can have them shipped prior to the start of your event.
        </p>

        <p>
            Onsite Registration/Check-in: In some cases, we can even provide check-in and onsite registration for your attendees.
