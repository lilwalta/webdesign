            We specialize in managing conference and event registrations. We can handle your registration whether it
            is large or small. Your attendees can pre-register at their convenience 24 hours a day 7 days a week! If
            your attendees are competing in events or selecting workshops while registering, we can customize according
            to your needs. We can create a customized login page for your group that you can directly link to from
            your organization's website.
        </p>

            We will provide you with valuable administrative features, including the ability to see how many participants
            you have registered for your event at any time, and registration revenue. You are given the ability to turn
            your registration system on or off, adjust fees charged to conference participants and send out broadcast
            email announcements to your conference participants from your administrative login. All registration data
            can also be imported into an Excel or Access file.
        </p>

        <p>
            The entire registration process is completed on our site and servers. There is no need for any modifications
            to your organization's site. We will provide you with a link to your customized login page, and it is suggested
            that you add that link to your site.
