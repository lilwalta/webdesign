            Most of the people designing the first websites were not graphic designers and lacked the understanding of the basic design concepts
            required to produce a quality website. They simply used software applications, such as Front Page or Dreamweaver which wrote code for them,
            and this allowed people to easily produce their own basic website.

            HTML was still relatively new so there were not all that many people who could code websites, much less who could code them well.
            HTML was designed as an easy formatting language for the public to learn, so it did not take long for people to start picking up on it
            and wanting to do more! Colleges were the first to offer courses in website design in the 90s, and HTML because it was still considered
            a new technology and colleges were quick to offer courses in HTML because it was an inexpensive technology and many saw the potential and
            benefits of it because the Internet had been around in the Universities for years before the World Wide Web came along.
