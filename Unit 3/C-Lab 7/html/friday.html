            The day Friday was also derived from the Norse goddess Frigg, who was the name sake of the planet Venus referred
            to by the Norse as Friggjarstjarna. Frigg was the wife of Oden in Norse mythology and was goddess of love and beauty.
            The Roman equivalent was Veneris whom the planet Venus was named after and in Greek culture she was the goddess named Aphrodite.
