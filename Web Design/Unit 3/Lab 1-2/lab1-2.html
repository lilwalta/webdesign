    <h2>Designing for laptop and desktop viewing</h2>
    <p>When designing a website to be viewed on a computer, it is important to take into
        account the different browsers that your visitors might be using. Different browsers
        interpret the tags in different ways, however by properly declaring your document using
        the DOCTYPE tag, you are more likely to get the results you are expecting.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Devices</h2>
    <h3>Tablets</h3>
    <p>When designing for tablets, one must remember that tablets are navigated by touch and generally have smaller screen sizes.
    The links must be separated, or large enough, so that when a link is touched, only the desired page opens. It can be very frustrating for a visitor
    to your site to have difficulties getting the right link to open because they are positioned so close together. The screen sizes of tablets are also
    an area to consider. Generally, they are smaller than laptop or monitor screens, therefor you should consider the layout size of your content. It is
    difficult and unnatural to scroll sideways on a tablet, so you want to make sure that everything fits within the width of the tablet screen.</p>
    <h3>Smart Phones</h3>
    <p>Making your website compatible with smartphone screens can be difficult. Some website designers recommend creating a separate
    site designed just for mobile devices because designing a site that is compatible for the phone, which would mean the longer screen width,
    larger links, and limited information on the pages.</p>
